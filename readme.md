## Background
I'm using jokes dataset with uitilites of external [JokesAPI](https://v2.jokeapi.dev/) . There are sevaral categories `Misc, Programming, Dark, Pun, Spooky, Christmas` and there are multiple filters for user in order to pick the rightmost joke. For example: forbidden topics like `racist` or `sexsual`, `safe-mode` for children, `search` bar and more.

## Running Instructions
#### Stage 1: run in terminal
After cloning the repository to your local directory (```mkdir <your directory>```) --> navigate to it via 
```cd <your directory path>```

#### Stage 2: install's npm's
```npm i```

#### Stage 3: Run Server
Our Server will run on port `3000` by typing the command ```nodemon index.js``` on terminal.
